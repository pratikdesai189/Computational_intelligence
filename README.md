# Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Algorithm

## Overview

The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Algorithm is a powerful time series analysis technique used for measuring the similarity between two time series sequences. This repository contains the implementation of the DTW algorithm in Python. It is designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to use for various time series analysis tasks.


## Requirements
* [PyAudio](http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
* [Anaconda3 (Python3.5+)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
* [Librosa](http://librosa.github.io/librosa): `pip install librosa`

### Scripts:
1. dtw.py - Demonstrate normal functionality of DTW algorithm.
2. dtwTest.py - Unit test
3. VoiceCommand.py - one argument has to pass, which is consider as test audio, Test audio can be any audion from test folder.
4. Shape.py - one argument has to pass **detection_for** - this implementation is mainly for pothole detection, this configuration added for scope.
Right now user has to provide 'pothole' as a argument.
